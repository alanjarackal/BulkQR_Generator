# Bulk QR Generation - Print Ready Format

A user-friendly web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to generate bulk QR codes from Excel/CSV uploads or manual entry and output them precisely formatted onto an A4 PDF for printing.

The core requirement of this tool is to ensure each QR code is exactly 3.5cm x 3.5cm on the final PDF output, enabling users to print accurate, scannable labels.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Input Flexibility:** Upload .xlsx or .csv files, or use the dynamic manual form builder.
- **JSON Payload:** Each record (row) is automatically converted into a JSON string, which is the content of the generated QR code.
- **Precision PDF Generation:** Uses jspdf for exact control over layout, ensuring all QR codes adhere to the 3.5cm x 3.5cm physical dimensions on A4 paper (210mm x 297mm).
- **Automatic Pagination:** Automatically calculates the number of QRs that fit on a page and creates new A4 pages as needed.
- **Customizable Captions:** Toggle a caption below each QR code and select any data field (e.g., SKU, ID, Name) to use as the label.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses Vite for its build tool.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and npm installed.

---

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/alanjarackal/Bulk_QR_Generator.git

cd Bulk_QR_Generator

#### 2. Install dependencies:
(Note: External libraries like jspdf, xlsx, and qrcode are loaded via CDN and do not require manual installation with npm.)

---
### Running Locally
Start the development server:

The app will typically open at:

http://localhost:5173

## 🛠️ Deployment (Vercel)

This application is designed to be easily deployed to services like Vercel or Netlify.

### Vercel Configuration

If you encounter the `vite: command not found` error during deployment, ensure your Vercel project settings are configured as follows:

| Setting | Required Value | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Framework Preset | Vite | Should be auto-detected |
| Build Command | npm run build | Ensures the local Vite binary is used |
| Output Directory | dist | This is generated by `vite build` |
| Root Directory | (leave blank) | Unless your project is in a subfolder |

---

### PostCSS/Tailwind Setup

If styles are missing after deployment, Tailwind CSS was not processed.  
Verify that these files exist in the root of your project:

- tailwind.config.js  
- postcss.config.js  

These are essential for Vite to generate the final CSS classes.
